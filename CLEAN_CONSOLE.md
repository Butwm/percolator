# ✅ Console Cleaned for Video

## What I Fixed

Removed all noisy console errors so your video recording is clean:

### ✅ Silenced:
- `console.error` for blockchain errors (still works, just silent)
- `console.log` for "program not initialized"
- WebSocket connection warnings
- TradingView telemetry errors (they're blocked by ad blocker anyway)

### ✅ Kept:
- Success console logs (Reserve, Commit flow)
- Phantom signing logs
- Important user feedback

## Remaining Console Messages

**You'll still see (these are good):**
- `🔒 Step 1: Building Reserve transaction...`
- `📝 Transaction received from backend`
- `🔐 Signing Reserve with Phantom...`
- `📡 Submitting to Solana devnet...`

**You won't see anymore:**
- ❌ Error logs for simulation failures
- ❌ "program not initialized" messages  
- ❌ WebSocket errors
- ❌ TradingView telemetry errors

## For Video Recording

**To hide ALL console:**
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Click Console tab
3. Click Filter icon
4. Select only: `Log`, `Info` (uncheck Warnings & Errors)
5. Or just close DevTools entirely!

**User will see:**
- ✅ Beautiful UI
- ✅ Smooth Reserve → Commit flow
- ✅ Clean toast notifications
- ✅ No error messages

**Refresh and record! Everything is clean now!** 🎥✨
