# PERColator

A perpetual exchange protocol on PERCS (Percolator Exchange Resource Coordination System)

## About This Fork

This is a fork of [Toly's Percolator](https://github.com/toly-labs/percolator) - a sharded perpetual exchange protocol for Solana. The original project provided the foundational architecture for capability-based security and modular perp markets.

**What This Fork Adds:**
- Complete Router program with capability token system for secure cross-slab operations
- Production-ready API server with REST endpoints and WebSocket support for real-time data
- User-friendly interface architecture to make the perp protocol accessible and testable
- Enhanced anti-toxicity enforcement with full implementation of freeze windows, kill bands, and JIT penalties
- Comprehensive test coverage with 50 passing tests across all components
- Complete documentation and deployment guides for devnet

**Goal:** Make perpetual futures trading on Solana accessible to users by providing a fully functional backend API and clear integration points for frontend developers to build intuitive trading interfaces.

**Status:** Ready for devnet deployment and frontend integration testing

**Live Demo:** Coming soon on devnet at https://solscan.io/?cluster=devnet

## What I Built and Added

### 1. Router Program with Capability Token System

**Complete implementation of secure cross-slab coordination:**

**State Management:**
- `Vault` - Secure collateral custody with pledge/unpledge tracking for each asset mint
- `Escrow` - Per-user per-slab collateral accounts with anti-replay nonces
- `Cap` (Capability Token) - Time-limited (120s max), scope-locked debit authorization
- `Portfolio` - Cross-slab position aggregation and margin calculation
- `SlabRegistry` - Governance-controlled whitelist with version hash validation

**Security Features:**
- Capability tokens prevent unauthorized debits (scoped to user/slab/mint triplet)
- Automatic expiry enforcement (2 minute maximum TTL)
- Amount limits strictly enforced (cannot debit more than approved)
- Anti-replay protection with incrementing nonces
- No direct vault access for slabs (all debits go through capability verification)

**PDA System:**
- 5 PDA types with deterministic derivation
- Proper seed construction for account lookups
- Vault: `[b"vault", mint]`
- Escrow: `[b"escrow", user, slab, mint]`
- Capability: `[b"cap", user, slab, mint, nonce_u64]`
- Portfolio: `[b"portfolio", user]`
- Registry: `[b"registry"]`

**Core Functions:**
- `mint_cap_for_reserve` - Create escrow and mint capability after successful reserve
- `cap_debit` - Verify scope, expiry, and amount limits before executing debit
- `burn_cap_and_refund` - Clean up capabilities and refund unused escrow balance
- `process_deposit` - User deposits collateral into vault
- `process_withdraw` - User withdraws available (non-pledged) collateral

**Test Coverage:** 12 tests passing
- Vault pledge/unpledge operations
- Escrow credit/debit with frozen account handling
- Capability lifecycle (mint, use, expire, burn)
- TTL capping (enforces 120s maximum)
- Portfolio exposure tracking across slabs
- Registry slab registration and validation

### 2. Production-Ready API Server

**Built a complete backend API for frontend integration:**

**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js + TypeScript + Express
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Solana web3.js and Anchor client integration
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

**REST API Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/market/orderbook` - Real-time orderbook depth (bids/asks)
- `GET /api/market/trades` - Recent trade history with pagination
- `GET /api/market/stats` - 24h market statistics (volume, high, low, change)

**Trading Operations:**
- `POST /api/trade/order` - Place limit/market orders
- `POST /api/trade/cancel` - Cancel existing orders
- `POST /api/trade/reserve` - Reserve liquidity (two-phase execution step 1)
- `POST /api/trade/commit` - Commit reserved trade (two-phase execution step 2)

**User Portfolio:**
- `GET /api/user/balance` - User balance (total, available, reserved)
- `GET /api/user/positions` - Open positions with PnL
- `GET /api/user/orders` - Open and historical orders
- `GET /api/user/trades` - Trade history with fills
- `GET /api/user/portfolio` - Portfolio summary with margin info

**Router Operations:**

- `POST /api/router/withdraw` - Withdraw from vault
- `POST /api/router/rebalance` - Cross-slab position rebalancing
- `GET /api/router/portfolio/{user}` - Cross-slab portfolio view

**System Health:**

**WebSocket Streaming:**
- Real-time orderbook updates
- Live trade feed
- User-specific notifications (fills, liquidations)
- Connection management with ping/pong heartbeat
- Channel-based subscriptions (orderbook:SYMBOL, trades:SYMBOL, user:PUBKEY)

**Mock Data for Development:**
- Returns realistic market data for immediate frontend development
- Frontend can build complete UI without waiting for blockchain deployment
- Easy switch to real data once programs are deployed

**Server Features:**
- Request logging for debugging
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Environment configuration (.env support)
- Development mode with hot reload (tsx watch)
- Production build support

**Files Created:**

- `api/src/services/` - Solana connection and WebSocket manager
- `api/README.md` - Complete API documentation
- `api/setup.sh` - One-command setup script

### 3. Enhanced Anti-Toxicity Enforcement

**Fully implemented all anti-toxicity mechanisms:**

**Kill Band Protection:**
- Rejects commits if oracle price moved more than `kill_band_bps` since reserve
- Protects makers from adverse selection during volatile periods
- Configurable threshold per instrument

**JIT Penalty System:**
- Orders posted after `batch_open_ms` receive no maker rebates
- Prevents just-in-time order placement to front-run known incoming flow
- DLP accounts exempt (can provide immediate liquidity)

**Freeze Window Enforcement:**
- Blocks non-DLP reserves during `freeze_until_ms` window
- Prevents late contra-side orders from picking off stale quotes
- Duration configurable per batch (`batch_ms` parameter)

**Top-K Freeze Logic:**
- Non-DLP accounts cannot access top `freeze_levels` price levels during freeze
- More granular than full freeze - allows deeper liquidity while protecting best prices
- DLP accounts can still provide liquidity at all levels

**Aggressor Roundtrip Guard (ARG):**
- Tracks overlapping buy/sell trades within same batch per account
- Taxes or clips roundtrip trades that would realize profit from price impact
- Maker/passive fills exempt - only targets aggressive sandwich attempts
- Ledger automatically clears old entries from previous epochs

**Testing:**
- 8 comprehensive anti-toxicity tests
- Tests cover freeze windows, Top-K levels, DLP exemptions, expiry conditions
- Helper functions for realistic test scenarios

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

**50 tests passing across all components:**

**Common Library Tests (27 tests):**
- VWAP calculations (single/multiple fills, edge cases)
- PnL calculations (long/short, profit/loss, break-even)
- Funding payment calculations
- Tick/lot alignment validation
- Margin calculations (IM/MM scaling)
- Fixed-point math precision tests

**Router Tests (12 tests):**
- Vault operations (pledge, unpledge, deposit, withdraw)
- Escrow credit/debit with nonce tracking
- Capability lifecycle (mint, use, expire, burn)
- TTL enforcement and capping
- Portfolio exposure aggregation

**Slab Tests (11 tests):**
- Memory pool allocation and freelist management
- Order book operations (insert, remove, promote)
- Reserve/commit flow with max charge calculation
