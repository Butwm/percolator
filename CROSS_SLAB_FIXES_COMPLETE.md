## **ISSUE 1: Execution Plan Not Calculating**

### **The Problem:**
When selling SOL with limit price $194, execution plan showed:
```
Execution Plan: 0 Slabs
Total Filled: 0 SOL
⚠️ 111 SOL unfilled (insufficient liquidity)
```

### **Why It Happened:**
```
Your SELL limit: $194 (minimum you'll accept)
Market price:    $185 (what slabs are offering)

For SELL orders:
  ✓ Execute if slab price >= limit
  ✗ Skip if slab price < limit

$185 >= $194? NO ❌
Result: No slabs match your requirement
```

### **The Fix:**
Added helpful messages that explain WHY it's not filling:

```
⚠️ 111.00 SOL unfilled

💡 Slabs are offering $185.01, but your minimum is $194
   Lower your limit price to $183.16 or less to fill
```

## **ISSUE 2: PerpDEX Nav Link**

### **Before:**
```html
<a href="/dex">PerpDEX → [Soon]</a>
```
Clicking "PerpDEX" took you to `/dex` page

### **After:**
```html
<a href="/dashboard">PerpDEX → [LIVE]</a>
```
Clicking "PerpDEX" now takes you to `/dashboard` ✅

Also changed badge from yellow "Soon" to green "LIVE"! 🟢

## **📊 Understanding Limit Prices**

### **For BUY Orders:**
```
Limit Price = MAXIMUM you're willing to pay

Example:
  You set: $200 (max)
  Market:  $185
  Result:  ✅ Trade executes at $185 (you save $15!)
```

### **For SELL Orders:**
```
Limit Price = MINIMUM you're willing to accept

Example:
  You set: $194 (min)
  Market:  $185
  Result:  ❌ Trade won't execute (market is below your minimum)

To fix:
  Lower limit to $180 → ✅ Will execute at $185 (you get $185!)
```

## **💡 Pro Tips**

### **Why Your $194 Limit Didn't Work:**

Think of it like selling a house:

```
Your house listing: "I want AT LEAST $194k"
Buyer offers:       "$185k"
Result:             ❌ No deal (offer too low)

To sell, lower your minimum:
Your new listing:   "I want AT LEAST $180k"
Buyer offers:       "$185k"
Result:             ✅ Deal! You get $185k (more than your $180k minimum!)
```

### **For Trading:**

**SELL limit = Your minimum acceptable price**
- Market at $185, you want $194 → Won't fill
- Market at $185, you want $180 → Will fill at $185! ✅

**BUY limit = Your maximum acceptable price**
- Market at $185, you'll pay up to $200 → Will fill at $185! ✅
- Market at $185, you'll pay up to $180 → Won't fill
